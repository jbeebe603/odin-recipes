        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Yields 1 cup (4oz) of sauce</h3>
        <p>Tare is a general term in Japanese for dipping sauces often used in grilling. It can also be mixed into broth when making soup to add complex flavors,
            or used as a braising liquid such as with Chashu. Tare is best described as a thickened, sweetened soy sauce for grilling. No two tare recipes are the
            same from chef to chef, with many adding extra flavors like dashi and ponzu, depending on their cooking and tastes. This will be a very basic Tare I use
            for grilled skewers (yakitori, gyutori), feel free to experiment and flavors that suit your taste or dish.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Yields 1 cup (4 oz) of sauce</h3>
        <p>Katsu sauce also known as "Tonkatsu sauce" is a Japanese Worcestershire type sauce. It is similar to "Brown Sauce" a product popular in the UK.
            It is not uncommon for different brands to include fish sauce, tomatoes, apples, lemon juice and various other fruits and ingredients common to 
            Japanese cuisine. Tonkatsu was first made in 1948 by the Oliver Sauce company of Hyogo prefecture. The composition of the recipe often reflects 
            cultural tastes, with the American Kikkoman Tonkatsu sauce being made primarily with applesauce, and Bull-dog brand in Japan leaning towards more 
            umame flavors like malt vinegar and yeast.

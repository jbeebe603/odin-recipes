    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Curry was originally introduced to Japan during the Meiji era (1868-1912), likely by British Naval officers or merchants, after Matthew Perry's trade
        expedition. Over time the Japanese reinvented the dish to suit local tastes, resulting in a milder spice level and sweeter flavor (many recipes us fruit).
        Despite being Yoshoku (Western Food) curry and rice has become a staple home comfort food.

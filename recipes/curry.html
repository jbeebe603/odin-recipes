    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Serves 12</h3>
    <p>Curry was originally introduced to Japan during the Meiji era (1868-1912), likely by British Naval officers or merchants, after Matthew Perry's trade
        expedition. Over time the Japanese reinvented the dish to suit local tastes, resulting in a milder spice level and sweeter flavor (many recipes us fruit).
        Despite being Yoshoku (Western Food) curry and rice has become a staple home comfort food.

    <p>The recipe detailed below will be my own personal recipe, and is fairly basic, however additional recipes can be found online. Some good resources prepared 
        by Japanese people can be found on the <a href="https://www.mod.go.jp/msdf/formal/family/recipe/archive/currey.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">

        Japan Times article</a> archived on IA and written in 2018. The most unique thing about my recipe is that I marinate the meat after cutting.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of minced ginger</li>
        <li>1 pound of pork</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups of stock</li>        
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by processing your pork. If it's not already cubed small or cut into thin slices do so. Make sure to reserve any fat to render in the pot or pan.</li>
        <li>Once your meat has been processed place it in a large bowl. Mix your soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, ginder and garlic and pour over meat.
            Mix to coat and let rest for 15-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the fat reserved during step 1 into your pot and render on medium low heat. Make sure to stir. If you do not have fat to render sub in some oil.</li>
        <li>Once you have rendered the fat and the pan is coated add your meat, allow it to drain some but don't dry it.</li>
        <li>Stir your meat and brown it for 5-10 minutes. As you do, you will notice the marinade boiling this is fine simply allow it to reduce and keep stirring.</li>
        <li>Proceed to add your vegetables and potatoes and continue to stir fry an additional 5 minutes. Then pour in your stock and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once your pot is boiling reduce the heat to medium-low and allow to simmer about 20-25 minutes. Stir occasionally and make sure to scrape the pan fond.</li>
        <li>Once the meat and vegetables have been sufficiently cooked simply chop your curry roux and stir it into the pot. Continue to do so over heat about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Your curry is now ready to serve. Traditionally served over a bowl of rice.</li>    
    </ol>
